TASK-2 Productivity Insights Deliverables:
1. **A Python script or equivalent with the code to load data, generate insights, and interact with the AI model.**
  - Please go through the app.py file,
  - Model used: "gpt-4-turbo"

  
2. **A sample conversation (logs of user prompts and ChatGPT responses) showing how the AI can provide productivity insights from the PR data.**
  - Once you test the flow, you can access the log file at -  /chat_session.log

    
3. **A brief explanation of how you would scale this solution to handle large datasets and complex queries.**
   - Will include this along with TASK-1 Architecture design and share by 21st April EOD.
